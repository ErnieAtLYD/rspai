3. **Correlation Analysis**: Nice-to-have feature for insights
4. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensibility for future, not current need
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Enterprise feature, not user-facing

### **What Users Actually Need** üéØ
1. **Basic vault scanning** ‚úÖ (Working)
2. **AI-powered insights** ‚úÖ (Working)
3. **Privacy controls** ‚úÖ (Working)
4. **Summary note creation** ‚úÖ (Working)
5. **Simple configuration** ‚úÖ (Working)

## 4. Publication Readiness Analysis

### **Current State: 85% Ready for Publication**

#### **What's Blocking Publication** üö´
1. **Task 6 (Pattern Detection)**: 80% complete but not essential for MVP
2. **Enterprise features**: Over-engineered for personal use
3. **Documentation**: Too complex for end users
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive but overkill for initial release

#### **What's Ready for Users** ‚úÖ
1. **Core functionality**: Vault scanning, AI analysis, summary generation
2. **Privacy protection**: Reliable exclusion of private content
3. **Settings interface**: User-friendly configuration
4. **AI integration**: Works with OpenAI and Ollama
5. **Performance**: Fast enough for typical use cases

### **MVP Feature Set (What Users Need)**
- [x] Scan vault for notes
- [x] Generate AI insights
- [x] Create summary notes
- [x] Respect privacy settings
- [x] Configure AI models
- [x] Basic error handling

**All MVP features are already working!**
