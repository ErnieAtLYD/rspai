ANALYSIS: Examined existing AI abstraction layer architecture and found substantial foundation already implemented.

Current Architecture Assessment:
- EXISTING: Comprehensive interface definitions in ai-interfaces.ts with 600+ lines
- EXISTING: BaseAIAdapter abstract class providing common functionality
- EXISTING: AIModelFactory with adapter registration and creation
- EXISTING: Multiple concrete adapters (OpenAI, Ollama, Mock, LlamaCpp)
- EXISTING: UnifiedModelManager for cross-adapter management
- EXISTING: Advanced features: performance optimization, caching, batching, error handling

Architecture Analysis:
The current system follows a well-structured layered approach:

LAYER 1: Core Interfaces (ai-interfaces.ts)\n
- AIModelAdapter interface - unified contract for all models\n
- AIModelFactory interface - adapter creation and registration\n
- Comprehensive type definitions and error handling\n\n

LAYER 2: Base Implementation (base-ai-adapter.ts)\n
- BaseAIAdapter abstract class with common functionality\n
- Health checking, performance monitoring, error handling\n
- Template method pattern for adapter-specific implementations

LAYER 3: Concrete Adapters\n
- OpenAIAdapter, OllamaAdapter, LlamaCppAdapter, MockAIAdapter\n
- Each implements adapter-specific communication protocols\n
- Privacy levels and capability declarations\n\n

LAYER 4: Management Layer\n
- DefaultAIModelFactory for adapter lifecycle management\n
- UnifiedModelManager for cross-adapter coordination\n
- Plugin architecture for dynamic adapter registration\n\n

LAYER 5: Advanced Features
- Performance optimization with batching and caching
- Comprehensive error classification and fallback strategies
- Resource management and monitoring

The architecture is well-designed with proper separation of concerns, extensibility through interfaces, and production-ready features. The foundation for Task 7 is already substantially complete.",
