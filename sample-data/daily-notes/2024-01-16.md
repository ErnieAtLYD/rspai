The technical issues today reminded me how fragile our systems can be. It's a good reminder to:
1. Always have backup plans
2. Document everything thoroughly
3. Invest in robust monitoring

Feeling a bit overwhelmed with the workload lately. Considering talking to my manager about redistributing some responsibilities. The new project timeline seems unrealistic.
