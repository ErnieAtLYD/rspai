# Mobile App Development Project

## Project Overview
Building a cross-platform mobile application for task management and productivity tracking. Target launch: Q2 2024.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Deployment**: AWS ECS

## Progress Log

### Week 1 (Jan 8-14)
#### Completed
- [x] Project setup and repository initialization
- [x] Basic navigation structure
- [x] User authentication flow design
- [x] Database schema design

#### Blockers
- None

#### Next Week
- Implement login/signup screens
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Week 2 (Jan 15-21)
#### Completed
- [x] Login and signup UI implementation
- [x] Firebase authentication integration
- [x] Basic user profile management
- [x] CI/CD pipeline setup

#### Blockers
- **API Rate Limiting**: Firebase has stricter limits than expected for free tier
- **Design Inconsistencies**: Need to align with brand guidelines

#### Solutions Implemented
- Upgraded to Firebase Blaze plan for higher limits
- Created comprehensive design system documentation

#### Next Week
- Implement task creation and management
- Add data synchronization

### Week 3 (Jan 22-28)
#### In Progress
- [ ] Task CRUD operations (70% complete)
- [ ] Offline data synchronization (30% complete)
- [ ] Push notifications setup (not started)

#### Technical Decisions Made
1. **State Management**: Chose Redux Toolkit over Context API for complex state
2. **Offline Storage**: Using SQLite with react-native-sqlite-storage
3. **Sync Strategy**: Implementing optimistic updates with conflict resolution

#### Code Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 78% (target: 80%)
- **ESLint Violations**: 12 (down from 45 last week)
- **Bundle Size**: 2.3MB (target: <2MB)

## Architecture Decisions

### Authentication Flow
```
User Input → Firebase Auth → JWT Token → API Gateway → Backend Services
```

### Data Synchronization
- **Online**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
- **Offline**: Local SQLite storage with sync queue
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with user notification

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for non-critical screens
- Image caching with react-native-fast-image
- Background sync for data updates

## Team & Responsibilities

| Team Member | Role | Current Focus |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| Me | Tech Lead | Architecture & Backend |
| [[Sarah Chen]] | Frontend Dev | UI Components |
| [[Mike Rodriguez]] | Backend Dev | API Development |
| [[Lisa Park]] | UX Designer | User Experience |

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Timeline Pressure**: Q2 launch date is aggressive
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Heavy reliance on Firebase

### Medium Risk
- **Team Capacity**: Only 4 developers for ambitious scope
- **Platform Differences**: iOS vs Android feature parity

### Mitigation Strategies
- Weekly risk review meetings
- Prototype critical features early
- Maintain feature priority matrix

## Budget Tracking #private

### Development Costs
- **Team Salaries**: $45,000/month
- **Infrastructure**: $800/month (AWS + Firebase)
- **Tools & Licenses**: $300/month
- **Total Monthly**: $46,100

### Projected Total Cost
- **Development**: $184,400 (4 months)
- **Launch & Marketing**: $25,000
- **Total Project Budget**: $209,400

*Note: Budget details are confidential and not to be shared outside core team.*

## Key Learnings

### Technical
- React Native performance is heavily dependent on proper state management
- Offline-first architecture requires significant upfront planning
- Cross-platform testing is more complex than anticipated

### Process
- Daily standups are crucial for distributed team coordination
- Code reviews catch 60% of bugs before testing
- User feedback sessions should happen weekly, not monthly

## Upcoming Milestones

### February 2024
- [ ] Complete core task management features
- [ ] Implement data synchronization
- [ ] Begin beta testing with internal team

### March 2024
- [ ] External beta testing with 50 users
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] App store submission preparation

### April 2024
- [ ] App store review and approval
- [ ] Marketing campaign launch
- [ ] Public release

## Notes & Ideas

### Feature Ideas for v2
- Calendar integration
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Voice note support

### Technical Debt
- Refactor authentication module (too tightly coupled)
- Improve error handling consistency
- Add comprehensive logging system
