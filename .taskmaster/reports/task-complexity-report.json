      "taskTitle": "Implement Local AI Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down Local AI Integration into subtasks for Ollama API client, Llama.cpp integration, unified model management, performance optimization, and error handling with caching.",
      "reasoning": "The task integrates multiple local AI backends with advanced features like model management, performance tuning, and fallback mechanisms. Existing subtasks cover adapter implementations and model management, indicating a modular approach but still complex due to hardware constraints and API interactions."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Summary Generation System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand Summary Generation System into subtasks for summary template design, insight prioritization, natural language generation, evidence linking, recommendation generation, markdown formatting, and customization options.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires combining AI-generated insights with structured formatting and user customization, involving both algorithmic and UI considerations. The multiple detailed steps and test points suggest a medium-high complexity with clear functional divisions."

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Summary Note Creation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide Summary Note Creation into subtasks for note creation via Obsidian API, templating, backlink addition, YAML frontmatter generation, naming conventions, versioning, and conflict resolution.",
      "reasoning": "While this task is more focused on integration with Obsidian and file management, it involves several distinct features such as templating, metadata handling, and conflict management, making it moderately complex and suitable for detailed subtasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 11,
      "taskTitle": "Create User Notification System",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand User Notification System into subtasks for Obsidian API integration, notification types, user preferences, notification actions, queue management, history tracking, and do-not-disturb mode.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward UI and event handling task with moderate complexity. It involves multiple notification features but is less algorithmically intensive, warranting a moderate number of subtasks."
    },

      "taskId": 12,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Manual Scan Triggers",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down Manual Scan Triggers into subtasks for command palette integration, ribbon icon, progress indicators, scan options modal, cancellation, history tracking, and keyboard shortcuts.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves UI elements, user interaction, and integration with scanning logic. The multiple interaction points and state management increase complexity moderately, justifying several subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Automated Scheduling",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand Automated Scheduling into subtasks for schedule configuration, background queue, startup scans, idle-time scanning, persistence, override options, and resource-aware scheduling.",
      "reasoning": "Scheduling involves time-based triggers, persistence, and resource management, which add moderate complexity. The detailed steps and test strategy support a structured breakdown into subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Advanced Settings Interface",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide Advanced Settings Interface into subtasks for UI redesign, AI model configuration, folder selection, schedule management UI, privacy controls, summary customization, and import/export functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This UI-focused task involves multiple settings categories and user customization options. While not algorithmically complex, the breadth of features and UI considerations justify multiple subtasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 15,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Cloud AI Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand Cloud AI Integration into subtasks for OpenAI API client, secure key storage, consent workflow, privacy-aware data handling, usage tracking, model selection, and fallback mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "Cloud integration requires secure API handling, user consent, privacy controls, and fallback logic, which add complexity beyond simple API calls. The detailed test strategy and privacy considerations support a medium-high complexity rating."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 16,
      "taskTitle": "Optimize Performance for Large Vaults",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down Performance Optimization into subtasks for incremental scanning, change detection, caching, background processing, batch processing, progress reporting, and memory optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Performance optimization for large datasets involves complex algorithms for incremental updates, caching, concurrency, and resource management. The multiple detailed components and testing requirements indicate high complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Pattern Detection Engine",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 12,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Pattern Detection Engine into granular subtasks covering: advanced NLP model selection and training, modularization of detection algorithms (themes, blockers, sentiment, habits), integration of external AI services, scalable data pipelines, real-time and batch processing modes, user customization interfaces, explainability and transparency features, robust error handling, logging and monitoring, security/privacy compliance, and continuous improvement mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the integration of multiple advanced NLP components (theme detection, sentiment analysis, pattern matching, categorization), the need for scalable and performant architecture, AI service orchestration, and comprehensive testing. The breadth of required functionality, dependencies, and the need for extensibility and maintainability push the complexity near the top of the scale. Further expansion is warranted to address areas such as model lifecycle management, user feedback loops, explainability, and operational concerns, which are not fully covered by the current subtasks."
