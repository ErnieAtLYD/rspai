			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Pattern Detection Engine into detailed subtasks covering: (1) requirements analysis and architecture, (2) integration with AI Model Abstraction Layer and orchestrator, (3) extension of markdown processing, (4) privacy filter enforcement, (5) user-selectable analysis scope, (6) formal data model definition and validation, (7) advanced pattern detection logic for all required types, (8) performance optimization for sub-10 second scans and incremental processing, (9) chunk-based analysis for scalability, (10) integration with the Summary Generator, (11) comprehensive testing (unit, integration, privacy, performance), (12) documentation and developer handoff, (13) error handling and fallback strategies, and (14) monitoring and logging for production diagnostics.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to deep integration requirements with multiple subsystems (AI abstraction, privacy, summary generation), advanced AI/ML pattern detection logic, strict performance and privacy constraints, formal data modeling, and the need for robust testing and documentation. The breadth of required features and the need for scalability and maintainability push the complexity to the highest level. Expanding to at least 14 subtasks ensures coverage of all architectural, implementation, integration, optimization, and operational concerns, as well as non-functional requirements such as monitoring and error handling[3][5]."

			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 16,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of the Pattern Detection Engine into granular engineering, data science, and integration tasks. Include subtasks for requirements gathering, architecture design, module implementation (tokenization, TF-IDF, sentiment analysis, theme detection, productivity blocker detection, frequency analysis, NER), validation, documentation, integration, performance optimization, cross-cutting concerns (scalability, customization, explainability, error handling, security, continuous improvement), and user feedback mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a multi-component NLP system with advanced features such as theme detection, sentiment analysis, NER, and productivity blocker identification. Each module requires specialized knowledge, integration, and validation. The need for performance optimization, explainability, and user customization further increases complexity. The current subtasks already cover most core modules, but additional subtasks are needed for requirements gathering, architecture, frequency analysis, scoring system, and user feedback integration. The overall system has high cyclomatic and architectural complexity due to the number of independent modules and their interactions, justifying a high complexity score and a recommendation to expand to at least 16 subtasks for full coverage[5][3][1]."
