## Functional Requirements

### **Pattern Extraction** (Priority: Must-Have)

- Natural-language analysis of daily and weekly entries to detect recurring themes, productivity blockers, and sentiment changes.
    
- Recognize patterns across all life domains, not just work, including habits, moods, health, and personal activities.
    
- Identify language patterns indicative of procrastination, distraction, task-switching, or positive momentum.
    
- Recognize recurring phrases, topics, or emotional tags that signal underlying issues or successes.
    

### **Summarization** (Priority: Must-Have)

- Produce clear, concise summary notes in Obsidian that highlight key findings on a daily or weekly basis.
    
- Highlight the top three to five most significant insights, such as "You frequently mention running out of time before work sprints."
    
- Timestamped summary notes are easily accessible and linked to original entries.
    
- Clearly label the analysis scope (whole-life, work-only, custom) to enhance user awareness.
    

### **Privacy Control** (Priority: Must-Have)

- Enable users to tag entire notes or specific sections (e.g., #private, #noai) to exclude them from AI analysis.
    
- Ensure all data processing remains local, with no uploads or external sharing of user data.
    

### **AI Model Selection** (Priority: Must-Have)

- Users can select and configure the AI model used for processing notes, supporting both local models (e.g., Ollama, Llama.cpp) and cloud APIs (e.g., OpenAI).
    
- Provide clear guidance and transparency about the privacy implications of each model choice.
    

### **Settings** (Priority: Must-Have)

- Provide a settings page in the Obsidian plug-in panel for adjusting scan frequency, selecting vaults or folders, and setting privacy tags.
    
- Allow users to choose between manual scans and scheduled automatic scans.
    
- Provide options to select and configure analysis scope (whole-life, work-only, custom).
    

### Nice-to-Haves (for Post-v1.0)

- Suggest related tags based on detected patterns to support more granular tracking.
    
- Provide basic chart-based visual indicators to help users quickly identify trends.
    
- Offer preliminary mobile support with view-only access to summary notes.

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users locate RetrospectAI in the Obsidian plug-in marketplace or recommended plug-in section.
    
- During installation, users are presented with a brief introduction that outlines the plug-in’s purpose, privacy model, and key benefits.
    
- Onboarding guides users through selecting analysis frequency, choosing vaults or folders, picking an AI model, and applying privacy tags.
    
- Users are prompted to select their analysis scope and informed about the advantages of whole-life pattern recognition.
    

##### **Core Experience**

- **Step 1:** The User creates daily and/or weekly journal-style entries in Obsidian as usual.
    
    - The user workflow remains unchanged; the plug-in operates unobtrusively in the background or on demand, depending on the user's preference.
        
- **Step 2:** RetrospectAI performs a local scan of eligible entries at scheduled intervals, analyzing only untagged files.
    
    - Users can monitor a progress indicator during scans and have the option to pause or stop the process at any time.
        
    - If entries are malformed or unreadable, the plug-in skips them and logs the error (without interruption).
        
- **Step 3:** The plug-in generates and saves a summary note in a designated “RetrospectAI Summaries” folder.
    
    - Each summary note provides the date range, highlights key patterns, includes linked examples or phrases, and offers suggested focus points.
        
    - Users receive an in-app notification (toast or panel badge) as soon as a new summary is generated.
        
- **Step 4:** User reviews summary notes, clicks through to original entries as desired, and can add reactions or tags for future reference.
    
    - Users can archive, pin, or delete summary notes to effectively manage their summaries.


##### **Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

- Users can initiate re-scans at any time, such as after editing or updating previous notes.
    
- If privacy tags are added/removed, the plug-in can retroactively update what’s included in future analyses.
    
- For large vaults, the plug-in can process data in chunks or prompt users to select smaller subsets for analysis.
    
- The plug-in gracefully handles ambiguous note structures or multiple languages by flagging unclear content, rather than forcing it into summaries.
    

##### **UI/UX Highlights**

- All plugin UI aligns with the user’s current Obsidian theme—fonts, colors, contrast, and layouts inherit from the host.
    
- UI elements are built with standard Obsidian components (modals, side panels, settings tabs).
    
- Support Obsidian’s accessibility options, with clarity and responsiveness across theme settings.
    
- Provide plugin output (summaries, status) as Markdown notes for native editing and flexible re-theming.
    
- No hardcoded fonts, colors, or visual branding; always defer to the user’s chosen environment.
    
- The plugin uses native Obsidian modals and notifications for setup, onboarding, summary previews, and key user choices. All dialogs leverage Obsidian’s built-in architecture for full theme and accessibility support.
    
- No custom pop-up widgets; all interactive dialogs and panels defer to Obsidian’s standard UI framework and inherit user-selected look and feel.

## Narrative

Alex, a marketing strategist with ADHD, uses daily journaling in Obsidian to stay organized. Despite these efforts, recurring issues like missed deadlines and a sense of overwhelm persist. These patterns remain hidden: “Why do I always feel like I’m spinning my wheels midweek? How come my best intentions never make it past Monday?”

Alex discovers RetrospectAI, completes a quick onboarding, and scans last week’s notes, excluding private sessions with a #private tag. Within minutes, a summary appears, highlighting frequent Wednesday rushes, task switching, and unfinished planning. It suggests, “Try scheduling Wednesday morning planning to address midweek crunch.”

For the first time, Alex can clearly see patterns that previously took hours of self-reflection, now summarized in a single, digestible note. By adjusting routines based on these weekly summaries, Alex feels supported and empowered to make meaningful changes.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Use a client-side TypeScript module architecture for the Obsidian desktop plug-in to ensure local processing and privacy.
    
- Implement local NLP pattern recognition to identify key productivity themes, blockers, and sentiment for user insights.
    
- Design the plug-in with AI model abstraction, enabling support for different LLM backends (local and cloud) via pluggable adapters.
    
- Set local AI models as the default for privacy, while allowing easy expansion to additional models in the future.
    
- Integrate a robust Markdown parser and indexer to handle all Obsidian vault content, including edge-case formatting.
    
- Provide a centralized settings UI for configuring scan intervals, privacy options, AI model selection, and output folder management.
    
- Support flexible analysis scopes, with clear labeling and tagging or folder options to enable inclusive or exclusive pattern recognition.
    
- Support multi-section, context-aware prompting to handle interleaved life/work/personal notes, drawing on Markdown headers, list structure, and note sections for more nuanced context extraction.
    
- Each generated summary should clearly state what sections/segments were included (e.g., “Based on: Brain Dump, project notes”) and offer the user an option—via settings or summary UI—to toggle scope (whole-life, work-only, custom).
    
- Allow LLM prompts to reference and respect user-designated tags (#reviewable, #ignore) or markup sections for inclusion/exclusion in the analysis process.
    

### Integration Points

- Utilize Obsidian API features for file scanning, summary note creation, and UI panel integration in v1.0.
    
- Use an in-app notification panel to keep users updated on plug-in activity and summary availability.
    
- No external integrations in v1.0, but expandable to cloud models if chosen by the user.
    

### Data Storage & Privacy

- By default, all analysis is performed exclusively on the user's local machine unless the user explicitly chooses otherwise.
    
- No cloud or external server communication occurs unless the user configures specific AI models that require it.
    
- Support #private and customizable exclusion tags or keywords, allowing users to prevent analysis of sensitive files or sections.
    

### Scalability & Performance

- Implement efficient, incremental file scanning to support large vaults containing thousands of notes.
    
- Use indexed scanning to avoid re-analyzing all files on each run, improving speed and efficiency.
    
- Design a modular architecture to support the future addition of new data types or analysis methods.
    

### Potential Challenges

- Variations in user note structures and writing styles may necessitate ongoing adjustments to pattern extraction algorithms.
    
- Address privacy concerns by clearly and visibly communicating how data is handled locally and how it may be affected by different AI model choices.
    
- Handle edge cases—such as file naming, vault size, or Obsidian compatibility—with robust error logging and unobtrusive user prompts to maintain reliability.
    

### Privacy/Tracking Stance

- RetrospectAI operates entirely locally by default with zero telemetry, analytics, or external network calls.
    
- If any optional feedback or diagnostics are added in the future, they will be strictly opt-in, fully transparent, and documented in settings and public code.
    
- Prioritize user privacy and community trust above usage analytics.
